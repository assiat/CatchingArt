## Catching Art
Catching Art is a street art platform. It's kind of a game. 
This plateform is developed as part of a university project.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
Be carreful update your npm package ( look as is link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18412129/how-do-i-update-node-js-and-npm-on-windows )
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the project is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarineLeM/CatchingArt.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the CatchingArt repository to a **CatchingArt** folder.



### Yo Generator
Another way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html), which generates a copy of the MEAN.JS 0.4.x boilerplate and supplies an application generator to ease your daily development cycles.


## Quick Install
To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```
To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`


## Running Your Application
Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
